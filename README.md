# Pixel Art Maker Project

### My First Javascript Project
This is my first go at an "app" that is fully functional. I've learned quite a bit on this little project. Since I've been developing for sometime and haven't really used pure .js or jQuery much at all. Thanks to Udacity I feel like I'm kicking a little ass. 

### Spicing Things up ###
I'm using several methods here

- ```empty()```
- ```append()```
- ```last()```

To name a few... I'm also using event listeners and event delegation. In the never ending cycyle of confidence and doubt as a growing developer, I feel pretty good ***today***. But let's see about tomorrow

Enjoy.
